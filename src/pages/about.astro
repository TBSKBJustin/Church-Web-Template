          <h2>關於我們的教會</h2>
          <p>
            親愛的朋友/主內弟兄姊妹：
            <p>
            歡迎您來到我們的教會。我們是一個傳講主耶穌基督和學習上帝話語的地方，我們相信為我們被釘十架和復活了的耶穌有改變人生命的大能，藉著祂我們能經歷上帝的大愛。聖經說，這愛「是過於人所能測度的」，藉著信靠主耶穌的心，我們便能親身體會。
            </p>
            <p>
            因著真神的愛，我們也是一個學習分享神的愛的群體，在愛中彼此建立，一同經歷在基督裏豐盛的生命。
            </p>
          </p>

          <h2>我們的使命</h2>
          <p>
            認識耶穌、經驗耶穌、 見證耶穌。歡迎您來參與。
            <p>
            二十世紀最偉大的科學家愛恩斯坦在1929年十月接受記者訪問。記者問他說：「你接受歷史上的耶穌嗎？」愛恩斯坦回答說：「毫無疑問！無人能在讀福音書時，不感受到耶穌的真實存在，他真實的人格如脈搏般跳躍在每個字句之中。這樣的生命不可能是個神話。」** 愛恩斯坦的話一點也沒有錯。如果您是追求耶穌基督的真理的人，我們願意和您一起認識和經歷耶穌基督的真實。歡迎您再來。
            </p>
            <p>

          <h2>我們的信仰</h2>
          <p><strong>Our Statement of Faith</strong></p>

          <h3>1. The Triune God</h3>
          <p>
            We believe in the Triune God as revealed in His plan of salvation in Scripture, who eternally exists in three persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – of the same divine nature with one another, co-equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfections. We subscribe to the Nicene Creed (381 AD).
          </p>

          <h3>2. Salvation through Jesus Christ</h3>
          <p>
            The Son of God, the Word in the beginning, became flesh for fallen human beings. Jesus, as fully God and fully man, lived a blameless life on earth and sacrificed Himself for our sins on the cross. For our salvation, He died on the Cross for us, and was resurrected before ascending to heaven as the eternal mediator between God and man. Though we are saved when we come to faith, salvation is a process whereby we may continually fail but God is faithful to forgive us as we confess our sins.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Salvation as the result of God's sovereign grace</h3>
          <p>
            In His love and mercy God offers us justification for our sins through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. When we accept God's salvation we are adopted into His family and become joint heirs with Christ. We want to live rejoicing in God's grace and His unmerited favor towards us, with the assurance that we don't need to strive to earn God's love.
          </p>

          <h3>4. The person, presence and work of the Holy Spirit</h3>
          <p>
            The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity with the Father and the Son. He convicts us of sin, regenerates believers, lives in all believers /giving us an assurance of our salvation, gives spiritual gifts to the Church so that each member may build up one another in love to the glory of God, and produces an increasing likeness to Christ in our characters. His presence is essential for us to worship, serve, minister and evangelize. We believe in followers of Jesus being filled with the Spirit.
          </p>

          <h3>5. The centrality of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ</h3>
          <p>
            In His love and grace God offers salvation to all; we need only repent and believe the Lord Jesus Christ and in the saving power of His death and resurrection. When we genuinely believe in Jesus as our only Savior we are justified and acquitted forever, adopted into God's family and are assured of eternal salvation. With the help of the Holy Spirit faith comes from hearing of God's Word that allows us to believe in Jesus Christ, to know Him and to live a life of discipleship following and imitating our Lord.
          </p>

          <h3>6. The authority of the Bible as God's infallible word</h3>
          <p>
            God has revealed himself in the Scripture (the Protestant Canon of 66 books). The Bible is His infallible Word given by the inspiration of God through human authors. This inerrant Word of God is our supreme authority for faith, life and doctrine, and we want to follow Jesus' example to believe, speak and live the Word. We need the Holy Spirit to help us to have a true understanding of the Scriptures. We commit ourselves to study the Bible and practice the truth taught in it by the power of the Holy Spirit.
          </p>

          <h3>7. The Church is the body and the bride of Christ</h3>
          <p>
            We are part of the Universal Church and together with all who truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ we make up the Bride of Christ. We gather as a local church committed to one another and to our leaders under the Lordship of Jesus as Head of the Church and ask our church family to be active members of the body of Christ.
          </p>

          <h3>8. The two sacraments of the Church</h3>
          <p>
            We believe in the two sacraments instituted by Christ for the Church: baptism and the Lord's Supper. A sacrament is the sign and seal of God's grace in Christ confirming to us our salvation through Christ alone and our union with the Triune God. We believe in baptism by immersion but in exceptional cases (e.g. for people with illness), we may practice baptism by sprinkling of water.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Marriage is a symbol of the union between Christ and His Church</h3>
          <p>
            Men and women are made in the image and likeness of the Triune God, to reflect His harmonious inter-personal relationships and interdependence. Marriage is between a man and a woman. Marriage between a man and a woman is symbolic of the union between Christ and His Church. We teach and encourage husband and wife to commit to each other in love and faithfulness in their marital relationship.
          </p>

          <h3>10. A lifestyle of love</h3>
          <p>
            As a community of believers, love should be our hallmark. We want to receive the love of God that is given to us, express our love for Him, and live a lifestyle of love towards other people. Jesus prayed that His followers would be united in love and we want to embody that, supporting each member of our family and being humble, for/giving and quick to ask for forgiveness for our own mistakes.
          </p>

          <h3>11. The second coming of Christ</h3>
          <p>
            We believe in that Blessed Hope, the personal, imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ.
          </p>

          <h3>12. The eternal state</h3>
          <p>
            We believe in the bodily resurrection of all men and women: the saved to eternal life and joy in the presence of our Lord, and the unsaved to judgment and everlasting punishment.
